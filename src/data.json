    "report": "There has been extensive tissue loss in the right cerebral hemisphere due to an old insult, presumably an ischemic event. This primarily involves the right temporal/occipital region and is associated with obvious ex vacuo prominence of the right lateral ventricle. There is wallerian degeneration of the corticospinal tracts/cerebral peduncle as further corroboration that this is an old insult."

        "report": "There are few focal defects identified in the periventricular white matter bilaterally. These are likely due to some superimposed small vessel ischemic change rather than a demyelinating condition. There is no evidence of focal defects identified within the brainstem at any level. The orbits are unremarkable."
